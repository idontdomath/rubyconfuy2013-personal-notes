nerrrdcore - A rubyst's guide to Design
---------------------------------------

Early and often a website design should start where its going to live.

3 Parts for a faster design process:

* Don't fear the white canvas. Sketches in paper.
* You can have a foundation.

## CSS Framework

pick and choose what adds a bit of value.
don't fear to rip out what you are not using.

Grids can be really useless.
But can help to format content.
960.gs (the original ganster)

bootstrap
skeleton
foundation

They are flexy.

Use of media queries, and are really awesome (conditional css).

light/darken.
syntax errors (quite useful in a rails app).

## Work within constraints

* Styleguides (aren't just for color palettes). Are also for CSS, JS, Ruby Code.

KSS (https://github.com/kneath/kss) A methodology for documenting CSS and generating styleguides

## Prototyping

* It's easy if you write code.
* Use gists, share with other what you are doing, or http://dabblet.com
