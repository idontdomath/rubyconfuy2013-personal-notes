## Rails vs. OOP

Cohesion and Coupling. 

* Low Cohesion, separate with a concern.
* Coupling. Active Record Base is an example (SRP). Domain Logic and presistence are tightly coupled.

SOLID Principles.

Singles responsibility principle base to cricize rails in usual. 
"A reason for change" = Uncle Bob. (That depends on the application)

Data vs. Responsibility (Practicing ruby)

Data Centric. (More classic) > Domain Driven Approach. (Low Cohesion). Rails uses this approach.

Modelling Around Behavior Centric. Artifacts that we create and are as part of th solution. (SRP is easy but leads to an anemic model). Growing OO.. JJ2E follows this.

Ceremony vs. essence..
Ending legacy code in out lifetime. > legacy as trying to capture irrelevant detail.
Coding need to effectively transmit intent.

Abstraction has a cost in terms of inderection (given we can't control more of 7 levels, as cognitive effort).
